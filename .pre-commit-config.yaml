  # General file fixers

      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer

  # Python formatting & linting
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.15.0
    hooks:
      - id: ruff-format
      - id: ruff
        args: ['--fix']

  # Python type checking (strict check in CI only, not in commits)
  # Note: Full mypy checks happen in CI pipeline, not in local commits
  # This prevents blocking commits while code is being fixed
  # - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
  #   rev: v1.8.0
  #   hooks:
  #     - id: mypy
  #       args: [--ignore-missing-imports]
  #       stages: [commit]

  # JavaScript/TypeScript linting
  # Note: ESLint runs in frontend/ directory with npm (not via pre-commit)
  # This is because frontend has its own package.json and dependencies
  # ESLint is called separately: cd frontend && npm run lint

  # Secrets detection (using built-in private key detection instead)
  # Note: Full detect-secrets integration can be added in CI/CD phase
